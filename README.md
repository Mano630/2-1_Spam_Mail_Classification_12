# 2-1_Spam_Mail_Classification_12


## Introduction
Email has become one of the most important communication tools, but with its growth comes the increasing threat of spam messages, which often contain advertising content, phishing attempts, or malicious links. This project develops a Spam Mail Classifier that automatically distinguishes between spam and ham (non-spam) emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques.

## Objective
-To build a robust classifier that can detect spam emails with high accuracy.

-To apply Natural Language Processing techniques for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).

-To convert textual data into numerical features using methods like CountVectorizer.

-To train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine for optimal performance.

## Key Features
-Clean and preprocessed dataset for spam classification.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding word frequency patterns.

-Vectorization using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model.

-Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

-Visualizations of word clouds and the most common spam/ham words.

-Model persistence using pickle for deployment purposes.
